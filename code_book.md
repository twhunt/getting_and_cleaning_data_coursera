The first two columns of the reduced data set contained in reduced_data.txt are categorical, and the remaining are numeric.
The reduced data set was constructed by combining the training and testing data sets, both of which contain sensor data.
Each row of the combined data set corresponds to a sample of sensor data when a particular subject was engaged in a particular activity.
