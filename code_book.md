The first two columns of the reduced data set contained in reduced_data.txt are categorical, and the remaining are numeric.

The reduced data set was constructed by combining the training and testing data sets, both of which contain sensor data.
Each row of the combined data set corresponds to a sample of averaged sensor data when a particular subject was engaged in a particular activity.
Each row of the reduced data set was generated by extracting all the rows from the combined data set corresponding to a single subject engaging in a single activity, and then calculating the mean for every column in this subset involving the mean or standard deviation, thus generating a new row of the reduced data set.

subject_id: Each of the 30 participants in the study was assigned an identifier from 1 to 30. subject_id is this identifier.
activity_type: Each subject engaged in one of the following activity types: walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, laying.
